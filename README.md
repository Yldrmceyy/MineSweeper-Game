# Minesweeper Game
## Overview
This project features a Minesweeper game developed using the Java programming language. The main objective of the game is to uncover all non-mine cells on the board without detonating any mines, thereby winning the game.

## Used Technologies
This project is developed using the Java programming language.The project utilizes Java JDK 19 for development.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- The player navigates through a grid-based game board, attempting to reveal all non-mine cells while avoiding mines.
- Each cell on the board contains a number indicating the count of adjacent mines. This information aids the player in determining which cells are safe to uncover.
- The player selects cells one by one. If a selected cell contains a mine, the game ends, and the player loses. Otherwise, the number of adjacent mines is revealed.
- By strategically choosing cells, the player reveals all non-mine cells to complete the game and emerge victorious.

## How to Play
1. Start the game and specify the dimensions of the game board (width and height).
2. The game board is generated, and mines are randomly placed on it.
3. Begin playing by selecting cells on the board.
4. Each selected cell reveals the number of adjacent mines, aiding in further gameplay.
5. If a mine is uncovered, the game ends, and the player loses.
6. Continue selecting cells strategically to reveal all non-mine cells and win the game.
